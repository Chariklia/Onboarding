We would like to store employee and their address details in a table.

Single Table (Employee)
	0.Employee ID (Primary Key)
	1.Firstname
	2.Lastname
	3.Date of Joining
	4.Designation
	5.Department
	6.Date of Birth

	7.Door No
	8.Street
	9.City
	10.Country
	11.Zipcode

Primary Key	- is a field/attribute that helps retrieving a unique recrd out of the table
-----------	- every employee will have a unique employee id
		- primary key is a mandatory fiels for every employee record
		- typcally primary key cannot be null or empty

To avoid duplication of information, we would like to split the single table into 2 tables
	1.Employee
	2.Address

Employee Table				|	Data Type

	0.Employee ID (Primary Key)  	|	int
	1.Firstname			|	VARCHAR(50)
	2.Lastname			|	VARCHAR(50)
	3.Date of Joining		|	DateTime
	4.Designation			|	VARCHAR(50)
	5.Department			|	VARCHAR(50)
	6.Date of Birth			|	DateTime

Address Table
-------------
	0.Employee ID (Foreign Key)	int
	1.Address ID (Primary Key)	int
	2.Door No			VARCHAR(5)
	3.Street			VARCHAR(50)
	4.City				VARCHAR(100)
	5.Country			VARCHAR(10)

SQL 	- Structures Query Language
